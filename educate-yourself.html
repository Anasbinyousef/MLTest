                        Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension.
                        It can come from any event or thought that makes you feel frustrated, angry, or nervous.
                         When stress lasts for a long time, it may harm human health.
                         There are two main types of stress.
                         Acute stress which is short-term stress that goes away quickly.
                         And chronic stress that lasts for a longer period of time.
                         During the stress response, your heart rate increases, breathing quickens, muscles tighten, and blood pressure rises.

                        The core symptom of depression is loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people.
                        It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping.
                         People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and suicidal thoughts.
                         It can either be short term or long term.

                        Bipolar disorder is a chronic or episodic disorder which means occurring occasionally and at irregular intervals.
                        It can cause unusual, often extreme and fluctuating changes in mood, energy, activity, and concentration or focus.
                        Bipolar disorder sometimes is called manic-depressive disorder or manic depression.
                        If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis, it is called mania and  if it is less severe, it is called hypomania.
                        During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy or irritable, and they often make impulsive decisions with little regard for the consequences.

                        Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's triggered by a terrifying event — either experiencing it or witnessing it.
                        Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event.
                        A person with PTSD is at a higher risk of suicide and intentional self-harm.
                        Most people who experience traumatic events do not develop PTSD.

                        People with schizoid personality disorder rarely react (for example, by smiling or nodding) or show emotion in social situations.
                        They have difficulty expressing anger, even when they are provoked.
                        They do not react appropriately to important life events and may seem passive in response to changes in circumstances.

                        The diagnosis requires a significantly low weight and the severity of disease is based on body mass index (BMI) in adults with mild disease having a BMI of greater than 17, moderate a BMI of 16 to 17, severe a BMI of 15 to 16, and extreme a BMI less than 15.
